/* ***************HELPER FUNCTIONS FOR GOLD RUSH BONUS TASKS*************** */
/*	
	This is kind of an explanation to how I solved the bonus tasks and how the helper functions come about.

	Let us consider this map:
	
	  1 2 3 4 5 6	--> (x direction) going down (y direction)
	  ----------- 	
	1|7 8 4 4 5 9|	
	2|2 1 0 7 8 9|	
	3|3 9 9 9 1 0|	
	4|9 9 9 9 3 5|
	5|9 9 9 0 1 4|
 	6|9 9 9 9 2 3|
     -------------	

    Lets consider these coordinates in the form (x,y), 

    The first component of gold is:
	[(2,3),(3,3),(4,3),(1,4),(2,4),(3,4),(4,4),(1,5),(2,5),(3,5),(1,6),(2,6),(3,6),(4,6)] 

	The second component of gold is:
	[(6,1),(6,2)]

	To find the components firstly we need to find all the cells that has 9 in it (letâ€™s call
	this array cells) and I store these while running the GoldRush function.

	Once we have found the components, we then iterate over these cells and for each cell we can 
	find all of its neighbours.

	Once we have found the eight neighbours we need to check whether they are in bounds of the map or
	out of bounds and we also have to check if the adjacent neighbour was already encountered or not.

	There is where the isVisited helper function I wrote comes into play, consider we start at cell(2,3)
	and we find all its neighbours and then recursively call the function on each of its neighbours 
	so now we are at cell(3,3) (because it is one of the adjacent neighbours of cell(2,3) and it also has a '9' in it)
	but when we find all the neighbours of cell(3,3) we will also find (2,3) since it is the neighbour of (3,3)
	but we have already encountered it before so can skip it. If we don't skip (2,3) then the function
	finds (3,3) again and from (3,3) we will find (2,3) again and so on and we will be stuck in an infinite loop.

	So the isVisited function is used to skil cells that were already discovered (since we don't want our recursion to be endless)
	
	So that is an explanation of how I found components for the bonus tasks

	If we want the amount of pure gold in each component then we take one component that was found by the above strategy
	and we check whether it has 8 neighbours with '9' or not.

		a) if the number to find is equal to to the input array element then increase occurences
		b) if the array element is not equal to the number to find then
			i) append 'i' element to output which is occurences
			ii) append 'i+1' element to output which is the number to find
